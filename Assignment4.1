Problem Statement 1:
You survey households in your area to find the average rent they are paying. Find the
standard deviation from the following data:
$1550, $1700, $900, $850, $1000, $950.

To solve this we have to use sequential five steps:
Step 1: calculate mean: This is done by adding the total numbers and dividing the count of the number.
($1550 + $1700 + $900 + $850 + $1000 + $950)/6 = $1158.33

Step 2: Now we need to subtract the calculate mean in the step 1 from each value.
$1550 – $1158.33 = $391.67
$1700 – $1158.33 = $541.67
$900 – $1158.33 = -$258.33
$850 – $1158.33 = -$308.33
$1000 – $1158.33 = $158.33
$950 – $1158.33 = $208.33

Step 3: Square the differences found in the step 2.
$391.672 = 153405.3889
$541.672 = 293406.3889
-$258.332 = 66734.3889
-$308.332 = 95067.3889
$158.332 = 25068.3889
$208.332 = 43401.3889

Step 4: Sum all the numbers obtained in the step 3 and divide by n - 1 (here is n=6):
(153405.3889 + 293406.3889 + 66734.3889 + 95067.3889 + 25068.3889 + 43401.3889) / 5 = 135416.66668

Step 5: Now the final step is to calculate the square root of the number we found in Step 4 (the variance):
√135416.66668 = 367.99
The standard deviation is 367.99.
